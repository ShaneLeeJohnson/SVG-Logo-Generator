# SVG-Logo-Generator

## Description

This is a command line application that allows the user to create a custom SVG logo by responding to questions that are prompted to them using the inquirer library.

## Installation

This application requires that the user has node.js installed as it will be used to run the application. They also need to install the inquirer dependency.

## Usage

To use this application the user will need to open their command line terminal (bash for windows). After making sure they have installed node.js and the inquirer dependency, they will run the command node index.js. The user will then be prompted with a series of questions that they will respond to. The first question asks the user to select from a list of 3 different shapes (circle, square, triangle). After selecting the shape, the user will be asked to enter a color for the shape. They can either enter a basic named color (e.g. red, orange, green) or a hex code for a more specific color of their choice. They will then be asked to enter up to 3 characters for the text that will appear on the shape. After entering the text they will be asked to enter a color for the text and can use named colors or a hex code for this color as well. After answering all the questions the user will see the text (Generated logo.svg) and a logo.svg file will be created. To see their logo the user can copy the file path and paste it into the address bar.
